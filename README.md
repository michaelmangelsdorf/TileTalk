# TileTalk
A tile-based messenger, Android client app and NodeJS backend

The repo contains source-code for a Jetpack/Android client app, and the corresponding server. The server is set up for a Postgres database, and includes the required migration files. 

Users can place icon symbols and messages into their grids, and share their grids with others, who in turn can respond with symbols and comments.

Tiles can be set to "emote" stored messages and do simple animations.

Long-press a tile to edit it.

Tap to see the stored message and comments - one comment per contact.

All messages are end-to-end encrypted and you can import/export your keypair to migrate to a different device.
